Detailed Algorithm Explanation
Part 1: Why Group by num % k?
Two numbers can have a difference of exactly k only if they have the same remainder when divided by k.

Mathematical proof:

If a - b = k, then a = b + k
Therefore: a % k = (b + k) % k = b % k
Example: nums = [2, 3, 5, 8], k = 5

num | num % 5 | group
----|---------|-------
2   |    2    | Group A
3   |    3    | Group B  
5   |    0    | Group C
8   |    3    | Group B


Why this matters: Elements from different groups can never differ by k, so they're independent. We can combine any subset from Group A with any subset from Group B.

Part 2: Building Chains
Within each group, we sort and find chains where consecutive elements differ by exactly k.

Example with Group B: [3, 8]

Sorted: [3, 8]
Check: 8 - 3 = 5 ✓
Chain: 3 → 8

Another example: nums = [1, 6, 11, 21], k = 5 (all have remainder 1)

Sorted: [1, 6, 11, 21]
Check: 6-1=5 ✓, 11-6=5 ✓, 21-11=10 ✗
Chains: [1 → 6 → 11], [21]


Part 3: House Robber DP - The Core Logic
For a chain like [3 → 8], we can't pick both 3 and 8 (they differ by k). This is the House Robber problem: count all subsets where we don't pick adjacent elements.

DP State Variables
take = number of valid subsets that INCLUDE the current element
skip = number of valid subsets that EXCLUDE the current element

DP Transitions
new_take = skip      # To take current, we MUST have skipped previous
new_skip = take + skip  # To skip current, we can take or skip previous
